# ProjectWork2025

This repo is made to store a text file that will 
be used in animating a clicker on an LED display.

The display is a 16x16 grid of LEDs that is 
indexed by hexadecimal numbers 0-f, and 
animations are made with premade commands.

This project was initialized as a requirement
of my first year project work.
